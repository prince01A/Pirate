## Read this please
I'm not the original owner of this repository

As you may know stanley deleted all of his repositories since he don't want to be associated with malware developpement anymore, as you can see he transfered ownership to me but what does that mean ? 

I will try to update PirateStealer, but take into account that I don't have that much free time to work on it due to college stuff bla-bla...
